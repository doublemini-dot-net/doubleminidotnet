# Double mini trampoline execution and deductions

The Score for each double mini trampoline pass consists of the difficulty and the execution score. The execution score has a base number of 10 (if both elements are valid) or a base number of 7 (if the dismount is invalid) from which the deductions are subtracted:

Each element can get a maximum deduction of 0.5 points for faults during the jump (lack of form and control)

For a faulty landing the maximum deduction is 1.0 points.

Additionally the gymnast might recieve deductions for touching the penalty zone in the trampoline or any other part of the trampoline other than the bed (net).

These deductions are explained in more detail below:

Penalty zone deductions
Lack of form and control
    position deductions
    late opening deductions
    twisting deductions
    Landing deductions
___

## Penalty Zone Deductions
 Each touching of the penalty zone is a deduction of 0.3 points with an exception for the "take off" of the mounting jump.

Only the red part between the mounting zone and dismount/spotter zone is a penalty zone. The red ends of the trampoline bed are not penalty zones.

 

A gymnast might touch a part of the trampoline other than the bed due to the narrowness of a double mini trmapoline. If he/she touches the trampoline with any body part, while staying with both feet inside the bed a deduction of 0.1 points will be made.

If one or both feet touch the frame or padding of the trampoline the pass will be invalid. See "jumps and routines" for more info.


## Lack of Form and Control
Each element can receive a maximum deduction of 0.5 points for "lack of form" 

The gymnast should demonstrate good form, height and control during each element (jump). Otherwise deductions for incorrect positions, late opening, pike- and tuck- down motions, late twisting and open arms after twisting will be made.

On elements with multiple somersaults there will be no deductions until the upper body reaches a certain degree of rotation:

For backward elements there will be no deduction before the upper body reaches 90°

For forward elements there will be no deduction until the upper body reaches 135°

### Position Deductions and Requirements
Each element can be performed in the Tuck, Pike or Straight position.

If an element contains multiple different positions the least difficult one will be counted  (tuck ist less than pike which is less than straight)

The position influences the difficulty value of an element. Click here to learn more about difficulty.

In all positions, the legs should be kept together, and the feet and toes pointed.

### Late Opening Deductions
In any somersault element that is performed in the tuck or pike position there has to be a so called kickout or opening in which the gymnast straightens his/her body again.

The kickout should ideally be done so that the feet and legs point upward when the body is completely straight. If the kickout is done too late the following deductions will be made:

### Pike-down and Tuck-down Deductions
If the gymnast bends at the waist or knees after opening, before completing 3/4 of the rotation, deductions will be made.

This movement is called Pike-down ﻿or Tuck-down depending on wether the gymnast keeps his/her knees straight.

In this animation the gymnast does a pike down before getting to the 120° mark ("2 o'clock"), and would receive a deduction of 0.2 points.

arms to stop twisting
A gymnast may use his/her arms to stop the twisting rotation in an element. If the arms are opened too far there will be a deduction of 0.1 points.


### Landing Deductions
The maximum sum for landing deductions is 1.0      Additional deductions will not be counted.

Landing in zone B:  0.3
Landing in zone C:  0.5

### Lack of Stability After a Completed Routine
The gymnast has to show a visible landing preparation and land on both feet in order for the dismount element to be valid. The gymnast has to stand still for 3 seconds after a completed pass and show complete stability after landing If he fails to do so the following deductions will apply:

Only a single deduction for the greater of these faults will be counted.
