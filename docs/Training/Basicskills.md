## Swivel hips
The swivel hips is one of the first combination of skills that a gymnast will learn. It's a seat drop, then a half twist into another seat drop without an intermediate jump to the feet. 

This skill also introduces the gymnast to the so cat twist, a form of twisting that is used in advanced skills like the piked barani.

## Back drop
 

The Back drop is the first backward rotation element the gymnast will learn.

Requirements:
-Legs pointing straight upwards

-Arms straight, pointing upwards

-Feet and knees together

-Knees straight

-Toes pointed

Progression:
To learn the back drop safely gymnasts should first practice falling to their back onto a mat without a trampoline. When attempting the skill on the trampoline a coach might spot the gymnast to prevent him/her from overrotating and landing on the head or neck.

In the beginning the back drop will be performed from the feet and onto the feet again. Learning to do multiple back drops in succession will teach the gymnast a lot about body position on the trampoline .
