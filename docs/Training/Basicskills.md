The straight jump is the most basic skill in trampoline gymnastics and the first skill any gymnast will learn.

Just as the name suggests it is a jump with a completely straight body. 

Straight jumps should introduce any gymnast to the trampoline and how to jump in a controlled fashion.

**Requirements:**
- Arms straight, pointing upward 
- Head between the arms, looking straight ahead
- Back straight
- Hip straight
- Legs straight
- Knees and feet together
- Toes pointed

## Tuck Jump

The tuck jump establishes the body position that is required for many skills: the tuck position. The tuck jump also introduces the gymnast to the so called 'kickout', the opening motion that is performed to straighten the body after a position.

## Straddle Pike Jump

<img style="float: right; clear: right;" src="../assets/Images/Basic skills artboards 01 -03.jpg" width="350">

The **straddle pike jump** is also known just as the **straddle jump**.  
It involves executing a jump while separating the legs into a straddle position and reaching the hands towards the feet or ankles. The move integrates both aerial body orientation and limb positioning. When performing the straddle the feet are dorsiflexed, and the arms and hands are reaching towards the feet or ankles. The head is aligned with the spine, and the gaze is typically forward or slightly upward.  

**Requirements:**

- Legs apart (more than 90Â°)
- Legs horizontal or higher
- Hands on the feet/legs
- Toes pointed

## Swivel hips

The **swivel hips** is one of the first combination of skills that a gymnast will learn on a trampoline. It's a seat drop, then a half twist into another seat drop without an intermediate jump to the feet.  

This skill also introduces the gymnast to the so cat twist, a form of twisting that is used in advanced skills like the piked barani.

## Back drop

<img style="float: right; clear: right;" src="../assets/Images/Trampoline drops 01 -06.jpg" width="350">

The **Back drop**, also known as **back landing** is the first backward rotation element the gymnast will learn.

**Requirements:**

- Legs pointing straight upwards
- Arms straight, pointing upwards
- Feet and knees together
- Knees straight
- Toes pointed

Progression:
To learn the back drop safely gymnasts should first practice falling to their back onto a mat without a trampoline. When attempting the skill on the trampoline a coach might spot the gymnast to prevent him/her from overrotating and landing on the head or neck.

In the beginning the back drop will be performed from the feet and onto the feet again. Learning to do multiple back drops in succession will teach the gymnast a lot about body position on the trampoline.
