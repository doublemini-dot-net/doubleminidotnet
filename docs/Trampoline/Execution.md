# Trampoline execution and deductions

The Score for each trampoline routine consists of the difficulty and the execution score. The execution score has a  from which the deductions are subtracted:

Each element can get a maximum deduction of 0.5 points for faults during the jump (lack of form and control)

For a lack of stability after a completed routine (10 elements) a maximum deduction of 1.0 points can be made.

On this page you will find detailed explanations for these deductions.

Lack of form and control

horizontal displacement
position deductions
late opening deductions
pike down / tuck down deductions
twisting deductions
deductions after a completed routine

 

horizontal displacement
The gymnast must land in the center of the trampoline bed. Otherwise deductions will be made every time the feet or the hip joint touch an outer zone (landing on the line without touching the outer zone will not result in a deduction).

The horizontal displacement is either evaluated with an electronic measurement device or by 2 judges.

Deductions will be subtracted from the maximum of 10 points (if the whole routine is valid). The horizontal displacement score is then added to the execution score. Click here to learn more about scoring

Lack of form and control
Each element can receive a maximum deduction of 0.5 points for "lack of form" 

The gymnast should demonstrate good form, height and control during each element (jump). Otherwise deductions for incorrect positions, late opening, pike- and tuck- down motions, late twisting and open arms after twisting will be made.

On elements with multiple somersaults there will be no deductions until the upper body reaches a certain degree of rotation:

For backward elements there will be no deduction before the upper body reaches 90°

For forward elements there will be no deduction until the upper body reaches 135°

Position deductions and requirements
Each element can be performed in the Tuck, Pike or Straight position.

If an element contains multiple different positions the least difficult one will be counted  (tuck ist less than pike which is less than straight)

The position influences the difficulty value of an element. Click here to learn more about difficulty.

In all positions, the legs should be kept together, and the feet and toes pointed.

Tuck

late opening deductions
In any somersault element that is performed in the tuck or pike position there has to be a so called kickout or opening in which the gymnast straightens his/her body again.

The kickout should ideally be done so that the feet and legs point upward when the body is completely straight. If the kickout is done too late the following deductions will be made:

Pike-down and Tuck-down deductions
If the gymnast bends at the waist or knees after opening, before completing 3/4 of the rotation, deductions will be made.

This movement is called Pike-down ﻿or Tuck-down depending on wether the gymnast keeps his/her knees straight.

In this animation the gymnast does a pike down before getting to the 120° mark ("2 o'clock"), and would receive a deduction of 0.2 points.

twisting deductions
Twists in any somersault element should be completed before the gymnast completes 3/4 of the last somersault rotation. If he/she fails to do so a deduction of 0.1 points will be made.


arms to stop twisting
A gymnast may use his/her arms to stop the twisting rotation in an element. If the arms are opened too far there will be a deduction of 0.1 points.


Lack of stability after a completed routine
The gymnast is allowed to perform one additional straight jump after a completed routine. After this so called out-bounce he/she has to stand still for 3 seconds on the trampoline bed and show complete stability after landing.

If she/he fails to do so the following deductions will apply:

only a single deduction for the greater fault will be counted

Deductions:
Uncontrolled out-bounce:  0.1

Not standing still for 3 seconds:  0.1-0.2

After landing touching the bed with one or both hands:  0.5

After landing touching with or falling to the knees, hands & knees, front, back, or seat on the bed: 0.1

Touching or stepping out on anything other than the trampoline bed: 0.5

Landing or falling outside the trampoline bed or leving the trampoline area: 1.0

Performing an additional somersault: 1.0
