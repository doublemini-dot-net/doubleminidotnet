#Trampoline difficulty

Each element is scored individually on its difficulty value by the difficulty judges. The difficulty value for the whole routine is calculated by adding all difficulty values.

## difficulty calculation:

**0.1**  per 1/2 twist
example: full twist = 0.2

**0.1**  per 1/4 somersault (90°)
example:  3/4  front somersault = 0.3

**0.5**  for a complete somersault (360°)
example:  back somersault tuck =0.5

**1.0**  for a complete double somersault
example: double back somersault tuck = 1.0

**1.6**  for a complete triple somersault
example: triffis tuck (triple front somersault with 1/2 twist) = 1.6 + 0.1 = 1.7

**2.2**  for a complete quadrouple somersault
example: quadriffis tuck (quadrouple front somersault with 1/2 twist) = 2.3
 
**+ 0.1**  per completed somersault in pike or straight position with or without twists (except for single somersaults with twists)
example: Rudyout triffis pike = 1.6 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 2.2
