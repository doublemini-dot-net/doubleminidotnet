# About

We noticed that there is no comprehensive resource for Double mini trampoline and tumbling, so we set out to create a library of all skills, techniques and information on difficulty and scoring. We hope that we can give gymnasts, coaches and fans the information they need to advance themselves and the sport.

We work very hard to make this the best guide to DMT gymnastics there is. If you find any errors or outdated information please feel free to contact us by clicking below.
